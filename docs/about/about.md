### Comprehension checks

Automate the whole process and reduce teacher workload: AI models will automatically create short answer questions, evaluate student responses, and provide appropriate feedback.

iTELL automatically generates summary tasks and short answer questions tailored to your source material. Student responses are evaluated using state-of-the-art systems, ensuring that students understand the content they are reading. Students receive targeted, immediate feedback to help them efficiently address gaps in their understanding.
