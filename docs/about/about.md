# About iTELL

## What is iTELL

iTELL is an open source framework for developing and deploying intelligent textbooks.

## iTELL features

### Comprehension checks

Embed summary tasks and short answer tests into your textbook to ensure that students understand the contents of the textbook. Automate the whole process and reduce teacher workload: an AI model will automatically create short answer questions, evaluate student responses (both summaries and short answers), and provide appropriate feedback to students.

### Teacher dashboard

Keep track of your students' progress: how many summaries they have submitted, what scores they have received, how many chapters they have finished, and more.

### Data collection

Automatically collect rich data to further analyze your students' needs. Data automatically collected by iTELL include students' focus time on different parts of texts, the number of notes and highlights students left on different parts of texts, students' summary and short answer statistics, and more.

### Completely Open Source

iTELL is completely open source and fully customizable.
