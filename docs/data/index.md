# Data Collection

iTELL is designed for use by academic researchers who are interested in measuring and improving student learning outcomes. By default, iTELL collects data on the following:
- User Sessions
- Written responses to short answer questions and summaries and scores associated with these responses
- Keystroke records (only keys presses entered into an iTELL text box)
- Clickstream data (scrolling, navigation, etc. -- only within the iTELL web app)

The data that iTELL collects is stored on a secure database. When data is exported from iTELL for research purposes, all personally identifiable information is removed.
